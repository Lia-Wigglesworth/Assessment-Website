                    Vets religiously defend this brand. Perhaps that stems from Hill’s longstanding involvement in veterinary studies, or it could be because Science Diet is actually 
                    better than many nasty chemically-preserved cereal by-product cat “foods” .

                    My cat loved the taste of this food, maybe even too much! Hill's is one of the most well known brands of pet food and have scientifically tested their food so that it is
                    perfect for indoor, adult cats.

                    This cat food has high levels of fibre which support healthy digestion in your cat! It also contains omega-6 fatty acids and chicken which nourish the skin and coat.
                    The main issue with this product is that it contains lots of carbohydrates which is unhealthy for your cat. Overall, this is a fairly solid cat food brand, however you may
                    consider feeding your cat other more balanced dry foods.

                    an indoor lifestyle during the prime of their life. During your cat's adult years, you want to feed nutrition
                    that supports everyday health and digestion. Made for grown cats, this pet food made with natural ingredients 
                    uses DHA from fish oil to support brain health and eye development. Balanced minerals promote strong teeth and 
                    bones, while natural fibres promote healthy digestion for young cats, and easier litter box clean-up for you.
