            <h1>Why Adopt??</h1>
            <p>Every year, Purr-fect Pets provides homes for thousands of animals. By choosing to adopt from Purr-fect Pets, you are not only making a lifelong friend but also giving an animal a second chance to find a loving home. These pets have come to us for many reasons, and many of them were mistreated by their previous owners. All of these pets are well looked after and ready to find a better owner.</p>

                Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction. What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to. All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or confident with people and life in general. Cats are one of the most popular choices of pets, as they are cute, affectionate and convenient. 
                <p>With so many people moving to higher density housing, cats are a great option as they do not require that much space, many are happy indoors and they fairly quiet. Sadly, around 33% of cats in shelters around Australia were euthanised for lack of enough homes. While it is important that more cats are adopted and cared for, potential owners must also consider if a cat is right for them and their household. Cats are less expensive and require less maintanence than dogs and are quite self-reliant, however they also require lots of care and affection from their owners. All the cats and kittens that are available for adoption have had a behaviour assessment, to allow you to better consider if they would fit into your household. You can also consult with staff for advice about particular cats. It is important to protect the cat and making sure that they have a "forever home" and to also consider the interests of the owners. </p>

        <h1>Dogs</h1>
        <p>Dogs are Australia's most popular pet, with over 5 million of them across the nation and 40% of households owning one! Dogs offer unconditional love and support, increase opportunities to exercise and get outside and can lower stress for both adults and children. They can also help to protect your home. While dogs might not the be the best type of pet for apartments, smaller and less energetic dogs can be comfortable in these smaller spaces. Wherever you live, Bringing a new dog or puppy home is a wonderful, exciting experience. It is very important that you take the time to help your new family member feel safe and comfortable in its new surroundings, so the whole family can enjoy this new relationship. </p>
