                    Made in Australia, this pack of delicious Chicken Breast Fillets is a great local addition to the treat cupboard!
                    It is ideal for small to medium size pets

                    My Burmese and ‘bitsa’ dog have both loved these! They get them as random treats hand-fed 
                    and also in their toys. They seem to be good quality and I’m happy feeding them to my pets.

                    Every ingredient is human grade and suitable for both cats and dogs to eat. 
                    Ideal for small to medium size pets, these chews make for an excellent reward or 
                    in-between meals treat. They take a little longer to chew through so your dog won't 
                    be able to gulp the treat down in one go. These treats are equally perfect (or should we say, purrfect) 
                    for cats and work well as a boredom buster.
