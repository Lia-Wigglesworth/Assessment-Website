                    I only use natural products for our staffys and this one is big favourite. 
                    Their coats are healthy, shine and I've found this keeps them smelling cleaner longer.

                    Nice gentle shampoo. Dogs smell good after their bath, coats nice and shiny.
                    Some other shampoos that I have tried make one of my dogs scratch after bathing, not this one.

                    I purchased this on advice from a staff member at a pet store as my dog had a rash and was itching frequently.
                    Her skin was very irritated and it seemed like not much was helping.
                    The AloVeen seems to have helped by moisturising her skin and preventing dryness.
                    This is great as it can be used as a conditioner or moisturiser.

                    Aloveen Shampoo is a  moisturising, lightly fragranced shampoo which  
                    can be used at any age on dogs, puppies, cats and kittens. Its oatmeal formula 
                    leaves your pets coat feeling replenished and clean. Dogs and cats with normal skin will benefit from 
                    clean skin and fur thanks to the gently foaming shampoo base, the soap-free pH balanced formula that allows them to retain their natural coat oils
                    and a glossy coat. Aloveen is also ideal for pets who often suffer from dry and itchy skin as the formula can 
                    drastically reduce their discomfort through its soothing ingredients. Aloveen is designed to be left on the coat 
                    for 5 minutes to allow the properties to take effect.
