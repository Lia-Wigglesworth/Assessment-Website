                    I only use natural products for our staffys and this one is big favourite. 
                    Their coats are healthy, shine and I've found this keeps them smelling cleaner longer.

                    Nice gentle shampoo. Dogs smell good after their bath, coats nice and shiny.
                    Some other shampoos that I have tried make one of my dogs scratch after bathing, not this one.

                    I purchased this on advice from a staff member at a pet store as my dog had a rash and was itching frequently.
                    Her skin was very irritated and it seemed like not much was helping.
                    The AloVeen seems to have helped by moisturising her skin and preventing dryness.
                    This is great as it can be used as a conditioner or moisturiser.

                    Aloveen Shampoo and Aloveen Intensive Conditioner can be used on any dog or cat that enjoys a moisturising, 
                    lightly fragranced shampoo, and helps those who suffer from dry and itchy skin. The popular Aloveen 
                    range can be used at any age on dogs, puppies, cats and kittens. Its oatmeal formula ensures a soothing 
                    effect and leaves your pets coat feeling replenished and clean. Dogs and cats with normal skin will benefit from 
                    clean skin and fur thanks to the gently foaming shampoo base, the soap-free pH balanced formula that allows them to retain their natural coat oils
                    and a glossy coat thanks to the inclusion of emollients and moisturisers. Aloveen is also ideal for dog and cats with allergies who often suffer from dry and itchy skin. The Aloveen formula can drastically reduce your pets discomfort through its soothing ingredients. Aloveen is designed to be left on the coat for 5 minutes to allow the soothing properties of oatmeal to take effect.
