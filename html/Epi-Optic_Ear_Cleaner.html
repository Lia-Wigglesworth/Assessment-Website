                    Have used this on my puppy, it does a great job cleaning the ears and 
                    removing wax and debris. I also find it has quite a pleasant smell. This is the product of choice for pet
                    professionals.

                    My vet suggested I use this on my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. 
                    Fortnightly clean has kept his ears wax free and healthy for many years now. I always use it after 
                    his bath.

                    My dog (7y.o. Cocker Spaniel) had a nasty Pseudomonas ear infection, after spending thousands on vet 
                    treatments, all of which did work - I discovered Epi Otic, the infection was totally clear within 2 
                    weeks & continue to use as a mantenance cleaner. This saved my dog from expensive specialist fees & surgery which would've 
                    left my dog deaf. Thanks Virbac for a great product.
