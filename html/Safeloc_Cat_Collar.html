                    Product is adequate, however the bell attached is very quiet and I cannot hear my cat when he 
                    runs around with it

                    Our cat is an escape artist - he's destroyed two collars recently- but this one does the job! 
                    I love how extensively you can adjust it. It's a tough but soft fabric, and holds up well.

                <div id = "reviews3">
                    The collar was quite narrow and tje fastening didn't have a slider to adjust how much pressure is required to release the cat in the event of an emergency.
                    I found this concerning as every Rogz collar I've bought have had this adjuster. I questioned if it was even a genuine Rogz.
                    If I wanted an unbranded basic collar I'd have kept it but the price point and lack of safety adjustment was reason 
                    enough to return it.

                    Rogz make some of the most awesome gear around for pets and their owners, 
                    always thinking on their feet (and their paws!) to improve the daily life of cats and dogs all around the world.
                    Rogz Alleycat collars are perfect for curious felines. Made from lightweight nylon webbing, 
                    each collar features a break-away safety buckle designed to snap open if your cats collar is 
                    caught while climbing or slinking through tight spaces. You can even increase the break-away load, 
                    and still have your cat break free under a dangerous amount of strain. With reflective edging, 
                    these collars also provide maximum visibility for cats that like to explore during the twilight hours.
