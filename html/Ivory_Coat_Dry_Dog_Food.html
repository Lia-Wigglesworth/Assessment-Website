                    My cavoodle is allergic to chicken so I was recommended this dry food. He loves it! Previously I have 
                    tried other brands of dry food and he doesn't want to eat it, but he devours this one like its a treat.

                    My Airedale Terriers are allergic to beef, wheat and chicken. This product is perfect for them. 
                    We have fed this product exclusively for 3 years now,we couldn't be happier

                    We had troubles with our Mastiff boy around finding the right dry food (very picky and allergic to chicken) and when we tried 
                    this he absolutely loved it! It also makes a significant difference to his coat quality, he is soft
                    and shiny and his skin great in the areas that have less hair. 10/10 recommend!
