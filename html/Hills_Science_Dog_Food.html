                    Great - go try it! Your dog will love you for it! This food is just so good, you will almost want to eat it yourself!
                    Our dog loves this food and, as she's not much into bones, it also helps clean her teeth!

                    Bought this for my dog just gave her a few lumps with her food she eat it at first now she won't even 
                    eat that food. It is very expensive so now I don't know what to do with it.

                    My two dogs have been on Hills science diet oral care for some time now, have not just seen a 
                    difference in their breath and stool movement but they are more active and their weight is very
                    stable. Hills science diet oral care is an excellent product and an all round diet improvement
                    for dogs of all sizes and ages.
