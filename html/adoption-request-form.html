        <p>To start the adoption process for your potential pet, please fill out the form. Please consider your decision carefully before you 
        make this decision. If you are approved for adoption, you will be allocated an appointment to meet the pet/s you selected and to process
        the adoption. If this is successful you will begin a 2 week trial period. The trial is organised to ensure the pet is right for you.
        Hornsby Pet Shelter reserves the right to terminate the trial at any given moment, and until the end of the adoption trial, the pet
        is still owned by Hornsby Pet Shelter. Transfer of ownership will only happen if the 2 week trial is successful. Please fill out the form
        truthfully and in as much detail as possible. Our team will get in contact with you as soon as possible</p>

            Hornsby Pet Shelter is not responsible for any unforeseen illnesses post adoption. 
            Should an adopter wish for testing to be done for illnesses that are not visible 
            at the time of adoption, the cost needs to be covered by the adopter. You are also 
            aware that we cannot guarantee the future health and temperament of the animal.
