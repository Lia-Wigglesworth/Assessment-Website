            <p>Unconditional love. Devoted companionship. Constant entertainment. Most of us dog lovers know that life is better with a dog.
                Dogs can be there for you when people can't. Even just looking at them
                 makes you happier. It is no wonder that dogs are gloablly the most popular pet! There are so many different breeds of dogs 
                 which are all completely different and unique. Owning a great dane is very different from a chihuahua! This makes it possible
                  for them to fit into a variety of different lifestyle. Though, if you're unsure whether dogs are for you, here are some 
                  tell-tale signs.</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>You're an energetic and "outdoorsy" person who loves keeping active. Most dogs need a lot of stimulation, fresh air and walks so it would be best if you're happy to get out with them regularly. Though there are always dogs for those who prefer to stay inside!</li>
                <li>You have a backyard, easy access to parks and open spaces or live in rural areas</li>
                <li>You don't have long work hours or very demanding jobs. Dogs aren't solitary animals like <a href ="http://127.0.0.1:5500/adoptacat.html">cats</a> and need a lot of attention. </li>
                <li>You have more money to spend on caring for your pet. Dogs are substantially more expensive than cats.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While shelter dogs can be thought of as aggressive or poorly trained, for many of them this is not true. Sometimes dogs in a shelter 
                environment are extremely fearful or anxious, and these emotions will escalate into "aggressive" behavior. Fortunately, once 
                a behavior source is identified and understood, it often can be overcome with time, training, and confidence-building 
                activities. All of the dogs in our shelter have been tested for signs of aggression, particularly food aggression. The ones that
                are available for adoption have all passed a behavior test and have been identified as safe. </p>

Dogs instinctively protect their family
unit and home. They can be trained to 
alert or protect their owners of 
intruders. Many dogs wont hesitate
to put themselves in harms way to 
protect the people that they see

                <pre>Shelter dogs:
These dogs haven't done anything 
wrong and are deserving of a life.
While shelters across Australia do 
their best they are not able to provide
safe and loving homes for all the
abandoned dogs and these animals
could be euthanised as a result.

                <pre>Psychological benefits
The mental health benefits that dogs 
bring has been proved by many
different scientific studies. Dogs can 
help with depression, anxiety, stress
and reduce loneliness. Just petting
a dog can reduce blood pressure, 
slow your heart rate, and reduce 
muscle tension.

                Before getting a dog it’s important to consider what is involved in being a responsible owner and to decide whether 
                you’ll be able to meet all your dog’s needs throughout their lifetime. Dogs are wonderful companions but owning one
                is a long-term commitment, so make sure you are ready.

                <h1>Puppy or dog??</h1>
                <img src="../Images/dogpuppyimg.jpg" id = "paragraph2popupimg"> 
                <p>Puppies are adorable but it is important to remember this phase doesn’t last long, and all dogs grow up 
                    very quickly. Caring for a puppy generally takes more time and effort than caring for an older dog, 
                    so if it is a puppy you are after, be prepared for extra work. If you’re not particularly looking for a
                        puppy, there are plenty of great things about getting an older dog. Older dogs may have (at least)
                    basic training and have grown out of those puppy habits, like the teething phase when pups chew on 
                    everything!</p>
                <h2>To help you decide between a puppy and an adult dog, ask yourself the following questions:</h2>
                    <ul class = "list1">
                        <li>Would I like a dog that is already toilet trained?  Toilet training a puppy usually means taking them 
                            to a toilet area up to 10 times a day (and during the night as well) and rewarding them when they ‘go’ 
                            in the right spot. You will also probably find yourself cleaning up after the inevitable accidents during 
                            the learning phase. Older dogs often have at least some basic toilet training habits.</li>
                        <li>Would I like a dog that already has some basic obedience skills (e.g., sits for you, can walk well on a lead)?
                            Puppies will need to be taken to puppy classes and taught all of these skills using reward-based training. Training school is a very important part of being a responsible pet owner and while some older dogs 
                                often have basic training, they will still require some attention and guidance.</li>
                        <li>Would I like a dog that already has basic social skills (e.g., can interact safely and politely with
                            other dogs and people)? The first 3-17 weeks of a puppy’s life are critical for their social and behavioural 
                            development. During this time it’s important to make sure they have plenty of positive experiences with 
                            a variety of different people, places, sights and sounds, as they will influence your dog’s behaviour 
                            throughout the rest of their lives.</li>

                    also easily distracted by almost everything and they love to eat.

                            soft tissue in their airways is not reduced, resulting in the same amount of tissue being squeezed 
                            into a smaller area. This tissue obstructs airflow and causes major welfare problems.  They are also

                you provide - is no substitute for regular walks and exercise outside of the home. It’s also important to ensure

            <img src="../Images/Socialisingdogs.jpg" id = "paragraph2popupimg"> 
            <p>Training and socialising your dog (that is, introducing it to other dogs and people) is essential to ensure your
               puppy or dog has the skills it will need throughout their life.</p>
            <h4>Socialisation</h4>
            <h2>The first 3-17 weeks of a puppy’s life are critical for its social and behavioural development. During this
                time it is very important to provide it with positive experiences with a variety of people, places, sights and sounds.
                Experiences during this period can influence a dog’s behaviour throughout its life. 
                Hornsby Pet Shelter highly recommends enrolling your puppy in puppy school classes (or dog in dog school 
                if they need training). Even after this point it is still important that your dog interacts with others. 
            </h2>
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <h2>The RSPCA recommends reward-based positive reinforcement training as it is the most humane and effective
                way to train dogs, is enjoyable for the dog, and positively enhances the relationship bond between you and your dog.
                This training method sets the dog up to succeed and then rewards them for performing the ‘good’ behaviour 
                (positive reinforcement). Rewards can be in the form of a dog food treat, favourite toy, a nice pat, or verbal 
                praise in a pleasant tone of voice, “good dog”.
            </h2>
            <h2>By rewarding ‘good’ behaviour, you reinforce it and this helps make it very likely the dog will do it again,
                to earn more praise (or another treat!). Reward-based training does not involve punishment, force, or the assertion
                of dominance over the dog. Reward-based training also involves generally ignoring and not rewarding any ‘unwanted’ 
                behaviour. If dogs are not rewarded or given attention for undesirable behaviours, they will usually stop as there
                is no incentive to continue. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                For example: imagine a dog that jumps up to greet people –that may be OK for the owners but rather intimidating 
                when they’re out in public or if there are visitors in their home.  The owners have tried pushing the dog down and
                kneeing her to knock her off balance when she jumps. This has not worked, the dog seems to think it’s a game and in 
                fact, she now jumps from further away to avoid the knee. Hornsby Pet Shelter does not recommend this kind of training 
                and encourages dog owners to adopt reward-based training as a much more successful and humane technique.
            </h2>
            <h2>Reward-based training involves the following actions:</h2>
            <div class = list2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly the dog should be completely ignored if she jumps – don’t speak to her, don’t touch her and don’t make eye 
                        contact. She should only receive attention (including eye contact) when she has four paws on the ground. 
                        The moment four paws hit the ground – she should be rewarded.</li>
                    <li>The dog will most likely jump again with a little less effort – and again reward her as soon as those
                        four paws hit the floor.</li>

            <img src="../Images/dogfood.jpg" id = "paragraph2popupimg"> 
            <p>Providing veterinary care when needed is an essential part of being a responsible dog owner. Your vet can advise you on annual health checks,
                vaccination schedules, microchipping, registration, preventative health care (external and internal parasite prevention), 
                behaviour and desexing.
            </p>
            <h2>Feeding</h2>
            <h5>First and foremost, talk to your vet for dietary advice. Dogs should be fed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced
                commercial dog food that’s appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult) and health status. Check products
                comply with the Australian Standard: Manufacturing and Marketing Pet Food AS 5812:2011. Dogs may also be offered 
                raw meaty bones occasionally to provide some variety and to help keep teeth and gums healthy. Bones must always 
                be raw and human-grade. They can also be fed other meats and foods to add variety to their diet.
            </h5>
            <h2>Grooming</h2>
            <h4>Many dogs need regular grooming for their health, particularly long-haired dogs. In order to make grooming an enjoyable bonding experience that 
                forms part of your dog’s routine, it’s best to establish this habit early in your dog's life. Associate grooming with a 
                positive experience by rewarding calm behaviour with tasty dog food treats. If you wash your own dog, be sure to use 
                products specifically designed for dogs. Some types of dog may need regular hair clipping and professional grooming to 
                manage their coat. Talk to your vet for advice.</h4>

                Hey there, my name is Meela, it's lovely to meet you. I'm a friendly and playful girl looking for an experienced 
                owner to take me under their wing.This is my second time back at the shelter, I was previously adopted but 
                unfortunately I was not suited to that home. I'm now ready for a fresh start, maybe with you?I must be the only 
                dog in your home as I love all the attention and don't like other dogs in my face. I love to get out for daily 
                walks and sniff around so I am looking for an owner who likes to get out & about as well. I will not suit going 
                to doggy high-traffic areas like the beach or dog park, instead a bush walk would be way more fun, imagine all 
                the things to smell & see. I would be best in a home without children as I'm not really sure what those little 
                people are. I like the peace and quiet of a quiet/calm household. I love to play fetch, already know how to sit 
                & shake hands and am eager to learn lots more with you!

            Hi there, I'm Nina! I don't live at the shelter at the moment, so if you would like to meet me, please call ahead to 
            arrange a time with the staff! When I first came to the shelter with my puppies it was a little overwhelming. I hadn't 
            really ever spent quality time with people before, so it was a pleasant surprise to have kind people attending to my 
            every need. I was a little bit skinny, so I was sent out to a foster home with people who treat me as kindly as they 
            would their own dog, and I love it here! Now I'm a tad chubby but that's ok for now. My foster parents let me 
            inside, take me for walks, they talk to me kindly all the time and pat me gently when ever I am near them. I'm really 
            looking for a real home that can offer me the same kind of love that my foster parents have. Somewhere warm and safe, 
            with a family who treat me with love for the rest of my life. I will need to meet the whole family, especially any kids. 
            I probably could live with another dog, although I would prefer someone sensible and quiet, but I'm kind of loving having 
            a family all to myself too.

                Hello everyone, my name is Gloria!I took myself for a walk one day to find a good place to have my puppies, 
                thankfully, a kind person found me and all my babies and brought me to the shelter. The staff here at the shelter 
                have been helping me practice my manners and I know and respond to basic cues such as 'sit'. I'm already very well 
                mannered but continuing my training in my new home will not only help me further develop my skills but is also a 
                great way to help me settle in my new environment and help build the bond between be and my new family. I haven't 
                had much exposure to younger children and honestly, they make me a bit nervous. So I think I would prefer to go to 
                a home with children over the age of 12 years who can understand that I need my own space every now and then. I feel 
                the same about other dogs, I have met a few while in care and whilst I'm ok to be walked near another dog, I don't 
                like having them come up to me and invade my personal space, so the staff here think I would be best suited as an 
                only dog and avoid being taken to any off-leash dog parks or high-traffic dog areas so I don't become overwhelmed.
                If you think I sound like the perfect match for you and your family, please do not hesitate to bring all household 
                members to the shelter with you and say hello. I can't wait to meet you all!

                Sydney is a happy, affectionate girl who's tail never stops wagging! She can be anxious and stressed in new 
                environments, so it is recommended that her new owners be home for the first couple of days to help her settle in. 
                She is best suited to a home with structure and routine and an owner who can set her up to succeed. Sydney is quite 
                smart and knows some of her basic cues already, like sit, drop, stay etc. She would love to learn some more tricks 
                and further her training. She can be a little protective of her food so work on trade out techniques if you need to 
                take her bowl/bone etc and work on hand feeding her to build a positive association with food, particularly dry food. 
                She will need to be fed separately if she is to live with another dog. Sydney is looking for an active family who can 
                provide her with plenty of mental stimulation as well as physical. Just running her daily won't satisfy her. 
                She needs someone who will work her and train her and maybe even take her to dog sports. She may be best as your only 
                dog or if she is to live with another dog will need a thorough meet before going home. She is not suited to visiting 
                dog parks or off lead areas. If you think she might be the perfect fit for your family, please fill out an adoption 
                application!

                easy to train, as long as you have treats and time for me I can learn to do almost anything! The humans here have been 
                very impressed with my training and would recommend taking me to classes if you want to get the very best out of me.

                Hello there, my name is Tiny! I am the opposite of what my name suggests, the staff here didn't think that 
                "big scruffy long legs" would roll off the tongue very well! I'm hanging out here at the shelter while I await my 
                new home. My ideal new home will be one where I will be your only pet and best friend forever. I am in need of an 
                experienced owner, without children, and one who has owned a large breed like me before. My exact breed is unknown 
                but I am showing traits of a hound such as a staghound/wolfhound type. I forget my size sometimes, I like to pull 
                during walks so I have been walked using a balance harness while at the shelter. I have met other dogs while at the
                shelter and they are pretty exciting creatures aren't they?! I will need a home where there are no other dogs 
                please. I love to play with toys and I cannot wait to play together in my new, fully enclosed large yard. If I sound like
                the dog for you, please come meet me!

                Hey there! I'm Chika. I came to the shelter when I was very scared and skinny and the staff have been working hard 
                with me to help me get happy and healthy... as you can see, I sure am now! I still get worried about new things, 
                and because I haven't had a lot of experience in the world, that means lots of things can worry me at first, 
                but the more I learn the better I get and once I know you I'm very sweet. I've been spending some time in foster care 
                with a lovely family who have been helping me learn about life with a family. Now I love the car and walks with 
                my people and life is not scary after all! I'll still need a quiet adults only home with people that have owned dogs 
                before and can understand when I'm worried and need a little extra help. I would like to be the only dog in the home. 
                I don't mind seeing other dogs and sometimes even say hello, but I can quickly become scared so my own space would very
                advantageous in helping me to be comfortable in my new forever home. If you think you have what it takes to help me shine,
                please fill out the adoption form or get in touch!

                Hi there, I'm Panda! I'm pretty lucky to find myself here at the shelter, cause things weren't so good for me and my friends
                previously. But here we are, looking forward and excited about the future! I'm currently living in a foster home to 
                get me some life experience and I have to say, this home life is awesome! It does mean that you will need to ring 
                and make an appointment to meet me though so I can be at the shelter when you want to come! My foster says that I 
                am a beautiful boy who is so trusting of everyone. I love to sniff EVERYTHING and explore as much as I can. I love my 
                people and will follow you around if that's possible. I can be a bit jumpy, but I have just learnt to sit and wait. 
                I am good on lead and quite social with other dogs but I prefer just a few friends and no one too in my face. 
                I'm happy to just ignore them and move on too! I'm looking for a home that can be patient and teach me all they know 
                about being a loved family dog. I'd love to come indoors ( I get some couch time in my foster home which is just so 
                warm and comfy!) and have pats, cuddle time and sleep where its warm in my very own bed. I'm still learning about 
                living in a home, so you will need to be patient with me, but if you are happy to put in the effort then I know 
                I can be the bestest boy that I can be. I will need to meet and dogs or kids in the home to make sure that we can 
                all get along for forever. Cause this is a forever deal, right?? How wonderful!If you are interested in me please
            </p>

        <h1>Adoption Processs</h1>
        <p>
        Hornsby Pet Shelter is dedicated to finding loving homes for all of our animals. To protect our staff as well as the 
        wider community of NSW we've had to make some changes to our adoption process. If you are interested in adopting a 
        specific animal from our shelter, please fill out the  <a class="link2" href ="http://127.0.0.1:5500/adoption-request-form.html">linked application form</a> and our team will be in touch to 
        begin the adoption process. If you are approved for adoption, you will be allocated an appointment to meet your 
        potential new pet and to process the adoption. There is no fee for this service. Despite these changes, we assure you 
        that our standards remain the same - finding the perfect forever home for our animals has been, and will always be, our 
        top priority. We appreciate your understanding and patience during this time. With your help and support, we can ensure 
        that all our animals continue to experience the love and care that they deserve.
