                    Nicely made harness, easy to use. My cat doesn't like putting it on, but it's tons better 
                    than the old over-the-head one.

                    The photo makes this look pale baby blue, but it's actually a more vivid mid-tone blue edging towards teal. 
                    It isn't primary or super-bright, and I think it's a nice cheerful color, but if you're expecting baby blue 
                    you won't get it.

                    I was worried this wouldn't fit my cat. her head is small but her body has some side bulge,
                    so usually anything that fits her body is loose on her neck and vice versa. This harness is super adjustable and I was able to get it to fit her comfortably.
                    She's recently started to like going for walks so wanted to get a harness in prep for taking her outside.

                    The Catit Adjustable Harness and Lead range offers the perfect solution for your cat to enjoy outdoor 
                    adventures safely. The Catit Adjustable Nylon Cat Harness & Leash Set is made from safe, comfortable and 
                    durable nylon material. The harness and leash are also snag proof which prevents them from tightening 
                    when snagged or scratched. Adjustment sliders on the harness allow for a quick customized fit. The
                    gold-plated bell warns prey of your cat's presence. The harness is easy to use and its quick release 
                    snaps allow you to remove it with ease. The leash length is 1.2m. The sizes are:
                    <!--<li>Small: Neck 17.5-30cm. Body 25-40cm</li>   
                    <li>Medium: Neck 20-35cm. Body 35-50cm</li>
                    <li>Large: Neck 23-40cm. Body 35-60cm</li>-->
