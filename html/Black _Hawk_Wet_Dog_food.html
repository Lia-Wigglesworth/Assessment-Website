                    My dogs love this food. I like the fact that it's grain free and not as high in fat as most other 
                    grain free foods. I also use it to get tablets to the dogs. The smaller square pack is more like a
                    loaf and that works very well for medication.

                    My 12 year old Kelpie thrives on Black Hawk grain free food. 
                    These small cans are great as a treat mixed with her dry food (Black Hawk grain free chicken)

                    Since I started giving my puppy this brand, I noticed that my puppy was having running stools 
                    and at first though it was because I was change his food. It has now been two months and he still 
                    has running stools! Not only that, he also has diarrhoea, irregular bowl moments, blood, mucus 
                    and now having issues with passing stools.
